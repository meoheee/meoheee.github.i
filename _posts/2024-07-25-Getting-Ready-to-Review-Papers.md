## Getting Ready to Review Papers

I plan to read and post reviews of papers.
This is because ​**my professor assigned me to read 20 papers** by the end of August.
논문 리뷰 올린다. 교수님이 20편 읽으라고 하신다.

But, I thought it would be a shame to keep them just to myself...
I never expected my blog challenge would turn into a paper reading
shubal shubal beolsseo I'm tired
블챌이 이렇게 될 줄이야

So, I have a few rules for reading:
1) No using ChatGPT
2) No using translation tools
미친 미친 규칙


어우

​
There will be a few rules for the paper review posts I will be uploading.
논문 리뷰 앞으로 이렇게 올린다.

​
- Summary
I will post an overall summary of the paper.
요약

​
- Architecture
I will describe in detail the key parts of something developed or discovered in the paper.
대충 논문 중요한거 찝어 쓸거임

​
- Strength
I will discuss the strengths related to the paper's writing style or structure.
글 얼마나 잘썼는지 보게요

​
- Weakness
This is the opposite of the strengths section.
약점


- Review
I will share my overall thoughts on the paper.
전체적인 내 생각


- Improving
I will think about how this paper can be used as a reference to generate new ideas.
읽은거에서 어떻게 더 발전시켜볼 수 있을지에 대한 생각

​
If I don't post at least one paper review within a week, please leave a comment asking me to buy you a meal. This will be my penalty.

Additionally, if it seems like I've used ChatGPT or a translation tool, please comment about that as well.
